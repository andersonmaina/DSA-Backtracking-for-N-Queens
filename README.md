This repository features a comprehensive implementation of backtracking algorithms to solve the N-Queens problem plus the visualization of the algorithm. The N-Queens problem involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens can attack each other. This solution is designed to efficiently explore all possible configurations, demonstrating the power and elegance of backtracking in algorithm design. The code is well-documented and includes various examples for different values of N, making it a valuable resource for anyone studying algorithms, data structures, or preparing for technical interviews. Contributions and optimizations are welcome to enhance the repository further.

<------HOW TO RUN----->

Install python from officil website.

Create  new folder in the desktop.

CD into the folder nd run "git clone https://github.com/andersonmaina/DSA-Backtracking-for-N-Queens/tree/main"

Click on the folder path and type cmd and press 'Enter' . 

Run the commands below.

python -u "path_to_your_folder\DSA-Backtracking-for-N-Queens\nqueens.py"

To see the visualization of the algorithm run the command below(You need to have tkinter python module installed, run python -m tkinter to check if its present).

python -u "path_to_your_folder\DSA-Backtracking-for-N-Queens\visualizer.py"
